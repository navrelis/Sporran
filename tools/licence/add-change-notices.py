"""Add or refresh the "Changed by the Sporran project" notice in modified upstream source files.

LGPL-2.1 section 2(a) requires modified files to carry prominent notices stating that they were changed and the
date of the change. Sporran's public source snapshot has no git history, so every source file that came from
upstream and was changed gets a dated notice in its header. This script finds those files with git, works out the
first and last date they were changed by us, and writes (or updates) the notice.

Which files count as modified upstream files:
  src/, compat/          *.java / *.kt changed or renamed since the Kilt tag v21.1.13. Git pairs files with their
                         upstream file at 30% similarity (short renamed files fall below the default 50%), and a file
                         that git still sees as added counts as upstream if a file of the same name exists in the
                         tag (Sporran -> Kilt in the name is allowed). Over-marking is safe, under-marking is not.
                         The remaining files are listed as "Sporran-only" for review; files identical to upstream
                         are skipped.
  build-logic/           *.java / *.kt like src/ and compat/ (the Gradle build logic of Kilt).
  forge/, fml/, loader/  *.java / *.kt / *.kts changed since the commit that vendored them (see VENDORED.md).
                         Files added after vendoring are skipped.

Other file types are covered as well. In src/, compat/, build-logic/, tweakers/ and the root-level files
build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts, gradle.properties, README.md, .gitignore, .github/ and gradle/, every other file that git
reports as modified (M) or renamed below 100% (R) against the Kilt tag counts. Files git still sees as added do not
count, with one exception: an added file that sits in the same directory as a deleted file of the same extension
(for example a META-INF/services file whose name changed with the package rename) is its renamed upstream file and
counts. An added file also counts if it has the name of a deleted file apart from Kilt -> Sporran. In forge/, fml/
and loader/ the non-code files modified since vendoring count. Never considered are
.wakatime-project and everything under .knowledge/, testing/, tools/release/ and logs/. The notice goes into the
file in the comment syntax of its type, with the same two sentences everywhere:
  .kts, .gradle                    the /* ... */ block described above (also for *.kts under src/ and compat/)
  .properties, .toml, .yml, .yaml, two "# " lines at the very top (after a BOM), then one blank line; in a YAML file
  .gitignore, META-INF/services/*  that starts with a "---" line they go after that line instead
  .accesswidener, .classtweaker    two "# " lines directly after the mandatory header line (accessWidener ... /
                                   classTweaker ...), which has to stay the first line
  .md                              two one-line HTML comments at the very top, then one blank line
Fabric's access widener and class tweaker readers, Night Config's TOML parser (default_mods.toml) and
java.util.ServiceLoader all accept "#" comment lines.
Files without comment syntax (.json, .tiny, .txt, ...), the files in tweakers/ (ClassTweakerUpdater merges them into
src/main/resources/sporran.classtweaker, which would copy a comment into the middle of that file), binary files (NUL byte in the first 8 KB, or .png, .jar, .zip,
.jpg, .gif, .ico, .nbt) and files whose format is not recognised are never modified. They are listed with their dates
in docs/CHANGED-FILES.md instead, which the script writes (sorted by path, no timestamp, so it only changes when the
list changes).

Run from anywhere inside the repository (the script finds the repository root itself):

    python tools/licence/add-change-notices.py            # write the notices
    python tools/licence/add-change-notices.py --dry-run  # only report what would change
    python tools/licence/add-change-notices.py --check    # exit 1 if any notice or the list file is out of date

The script is idempotent: a file that already has a notice starting with "Changed by the Sporran project" gets
that notice rewritten with the current dates instead of a second one. In Java, Kotlin and Gradle Kotlin files an
existing licence/copyright comment at the top of a file is never changed; the notice is inserted directly after it
(or at the very top if the file has no such comment). Line endings, BOM and encoding of each file are preserved.

The commit that adds the notices would itself count as a change and move every "last changed" date to its own
day. To avoid that, commits whose message contains the --skip-grep text (default "change notices") are ignored
when the dates are computed, so give that commit a message such as "Add LGPL change notices".

Only the Python 3 standard library and the git command line are used.
