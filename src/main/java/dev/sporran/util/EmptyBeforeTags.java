/**
 * Sporran: remembers the objects that resolved a tag-dependent result to "nothing" before the tags were bound for the
 * first time in this game run, and makes them forget that result once the tags are bound, so they resolve it again.
 *
 * <p>Until the first data pack load has finished, every tag is empty. A result that is computed once and then kept
 * (the items of an ingredient) is therefore wrong for good when somebody asks for it that early. From the first
 * binding on nothing is remembered any more: a later reload is evaluated against the tags of the previous one, as in
 * vanilla, and an object that is still empty then really has no items.
 *
 * <p>The objects are held weakly and the list is dropped at the first binding. {@link #resolvedEmpty} may be called
 * from any thread; it is meant for the place where the result is computed, not for a path that only reads it.
