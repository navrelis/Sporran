/**
 * Sporran: the map keys that the spark profiler builds from the root paths of all Fabric mods, and a filter that
 * removes the paths whose key has already been seen.
 *
 * <p>spark ({@code FabricClassSourceLookup#constructPathToModIdMap}) puts every root path of every mod container into
 * a Guava {@code ImmutableMap}, whose builder throws on a repeated key. Sporran has the extra container
 * {@code neoforge}, whose root path is the root of the Sporran jar, so it has the same key as Sporran itself. This
 * class computes the key exactly as spark does, so that only true duplicates are dropped.
 *
 * <p>spark's key is: the file system's {@code toString()} (the path of the jar) for the root {@code /} of a jar file
 * system, and otherwise {@code path.toAbsolutePath().normalize().toString()}.
 *
 * <p>One instance is meant for one map construction: the first path with a key keeps it, later paths with the same key
 * are dropped. No game classes, so it can be unit tested.
