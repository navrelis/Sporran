 * Sporran: the camera roll that NeoForge mods set through {@code ViewportEvent.ComputeCameraAngles} and
 * {@code Camera#setRotation(float, float, float)}, as it reaches the camera's rotation.
 *
 * <p>The roll is in degrees, like yaw and pitch. The third argument of {@code Quaternionf#rotationYXZ} in vanilla's
 * {@code Camera#setRotation} is in radians, and NeoForge passes {@code -roll * (float) (Math.PI / 180.0)} there: it
 * converts the unit and also negates the value. Vanilla
 * passes 0 there, so the roll is added to whatever the argument already is, which keeps other mods' changes to the same
 * argument working.
