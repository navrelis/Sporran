# Vendored upstream code

The folders `forge/`, `fml/` and `loader/` used to be git submodules. They are now plain folders of this repository,
so the code in them can be edited here. They contain only what the build uses, plus the licence and credit files.
The upstream history is not carried over; the exact upstream commit each folder was taken from is listed below.

The Gradle build compiles these folders as part of the main source set (`forge/`, `fml/`) or as the Gradle
projects `:loader`, `:loader:fabric` and `:loader:cichlid` (`loader/`). See `build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts`.

| Folder | Upstream project | Upstream repository | Commit taken from | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `forge/` | NeoForge (1.21.1 port maintained by the Kilt project, based on NeoForged's NeoForge) | https://github.com/KiltMC/NeoForge | `4be8620fa70266a640fb04f6e72c8407bb2d3866` (`20.4-913-g4be8620fa`) | LGPL-2.1-only, see `forge/LICENSE.txt` and `forge/README-LICENSE.md`; credits in `forge/CREDITS.txt` |
| `fml/` | FancyModLoader (Kilt project fork of NeoForged's FancyModLoader, branch `1.21.1`) | https://github.com/KiltMC/FancyModLoader | `99aa898d99d718835af56d9a304dc5a4576c6968` (`4.0-75-g99aa898d`) | LGPL-2.1, see `fml/LICENSE.txt` |
| `loader/` | Knit Loader | https://github.com/KiltMC/KnitLoader | `b5f3fb0ab687f18af4735e9a2f9c9ab8d07c0664` (`main`) | MIT, Copyright 2025 KiltMC, see `loader/LICENSE` |

## What was kept

- `forge/`: `src/` (`main` and `generated`), `coremods/`, `patches/`, `LICENSE.txt`, `CREDITS.txt`, `README-LICENSE.md`.
  Dropped: `tests/`, `testframework/`, `buildSrc/`, `docs/`, `projects/`, `server_files/`, `codeformat/`, the Gradle
  build files and wrapper, `.github/`, `.idea/`. `patches/` is only read by the dev tasks `countPatchProgress` and
  `tagPatches`; it is not compiled.
- `fml/`: `loader/src/main/`, `LICENSE.txt`, `LICENSE-header.txt`, `README.md`.
  Dropped: `earlydisplay/`, `junit/`, `tests/`, `loader/src/test/`, `buildSrc/`, the Gradle build files and wrapper,
  `.github/`.
- `loader/`: `build.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, `cichlid/`, `fabric/`, `src/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`.
  Dropped: `quilt/` (its module is disabled in `settings.gradle.kts`), the standalone `settings.gradle.kts`.

The files that are kept were taken with `git archive` from the commits above and were not changed when they were vendored.

## Changes after vendoring

The rename to Sporran (see `docs/CHANGES.md`) edited these folders afterwards: in `forge/` and `fml/` the references
to Sporran's own packages, classes and `sporran$` members, the launcher/branding strings and the `// Sporran:` patch
comments; in `loader/` the comments that named the upstream mod, the description and contact links in
`loader/fabric/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`, and `loader/README.md` (replaced by a short description).
The licence and credit files are unchanged.
